	- fundamental revision of the code to avoid possible copyright questions from the Outlook Technologies, Inc.
	  My own decision to publish the code on CPAN could never be considered a kind of competition with OLT
	  business, since my layoff clearly demonstrate the fact that OLT has no business interests
	  in this market of products and services, and does not plan to work on this market in future.
	- documentation is edited appropriately.
