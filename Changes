Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Dynagzip.

0.10  Fri Jul 18 23:30:00 2003
	- Rob Bloodgood and Damyan Ivanov complained about "uninitialized value" warnings from unused
	  HTTP headers, and about pack mode "c", which generated warnings on their systems (running -w).
	  I failed to reproduce the effect of pack mode, but decided to change the mode to "C"
	  because it has been reported as a clean solution for both Rob and Damyan from one side,
	  and this should not effect the packed code (as I understand it) from the other side.
	  "Uninitialized value" warnings were blocked in accordance with the patch provided by Rob Bloodgood.
	  All changes were manually double-checked with the patch provided by Damyan Ivanov.
	- partial code revision has been done in order to prepare the further structural changes.

	- fundamental revision of the code to avoid possible copyright questions from Outlook Technologies, Inc.
	  My own decision to publish the code on CPAN could never be considered an any kind of competition with OLT
	  business, since my layoff clearly demonstrates the fact, that OLT has no business interests
	  in this market of products and services, and does not plan to work on this market in future.
	- documentation is edited appropriately.
