I'm not sure that
Dynamic control via notes() over the

 - minChunkSize
 - minChunkSizeSource
 - minChunkSizePP
 - etc.
is much better, than dynamic setup of appropriate conf variables...

Microsoft has a tendency to IGNORE the HTTP headers and to "detect" the
document type itself.  e.g. I could send a MIME type of image/gif, but
if the content is HTML, some versions of IE will display it as HTML
rather than trying to decode it as GIF.  This might seem like a good thing
to you, but it was the cause of a large security hole some months ago.

Along with the Microsoft detection "feature", Microsoft tends to read the
HTTP META tags in the document (not the headers), and sometimes actually
listens to them.

Therefore, defensive programming and web publishing suggests that you should
duplicate important header tags such as Vary in the HTTP header AND in the
HTML document <head> section.

Subject: "Streaming" compression of output from mod_perl handler?
Date: Tue, 19 Feb 2002 09:01:34 +0100

So I am basically looking for anyone who has had any success in achieving this kind of "streaming" compression, who could direct me at an appropriate Apache module.
